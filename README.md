# Celebrity-Face-Recognition

## Introduction
This project demonstrates face and eye detection in images using OpenCV. Additionally, it includes a function to perform Wavelet Transform on images, which can be used for various image processing tasks. The project utilizes Haar cascades for detecting faces and eyes, and the `pywt` library for performing Wavelet Transforms.

## Features
- Detect faces in an image
- Detect eyes within the detected faces
- Perform Wavelet Transform on the detected face regions
- Crop and return face regions with at least two detected eyes

## Installation
To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deeptimaan-k/Celebrity-Face-Recognition
